        Since the inception of the Formula One World Championship in 1950, it is
        widely recognised as the world's most prestigious motor racing
        competition, as well as the world's most popular annual sporting series.
        The sport has always sought to innovate, constantly pushing the
        technological boundaries in order to find the quickest route to victory.
        The sport has frequently pioneered technology that has been successfully
        transferred to everyday transport. In 2014, with the introduction of a
        new hybrid 1.6 litre, turbo-charged V6 power unit, Formula 1 continued
        its aim to place the world's foremost single-seat racing series at the
        cutting edge of automotive technology development. For the next
        generation power unit there is the commitment to move to advanced
        sustainable fuels in 2026, remaining true to the culture of innovation,
        while at the same time preserving the capacity to thrill that has been
        at the heart of the sport since its earliest days.
